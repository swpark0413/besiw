Description: This package provides a Bayesian method for estimating the eigenstructure of high-dimensional covariance matrices using the generalized shrinkage inverse-Wishart (gSIW) prior. It implements MCMC-based posterior sampling for eigenvalues and eigenvectors, along with functions for model selection, diagnostic plotting, and posterior point and interval estimation. The gSIW prior generalizes the inverse-Wishart and shrinkage inverse-Wishart priors, offering improved accuracy when the sample covariance eigenstructure is inconsistent. Theoretical properties and empirical performance are supported by asymptotic analysis and simulation studies.
